We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a single layer neural network in TensorFlow.

## Environment Set-up

Follow the set-up instruction for the [Term 1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit). Contained within are instructions for utilizing a Jupyter notebook within Docker; if you use Anaconda make sure to activate the environment first with
```
source activate {environment_name}
```
and then open the notebook with
```
jupyter notebook
```

#### The Lab

The notebook has 3 problems for you to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
 - Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy

This is a self-assessed lab.  Compare your answers to the solutions [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/blob/master/solutions.ipynb).  If you have any difficulty completing the lab, Udacity provides a few services to answer any questions you might have.


## Help
Remember that you can get assistance from mentors and fellow students in Student Hub or in Knowledge. You can also review the concepts from the previous lessons.
